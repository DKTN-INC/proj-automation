## Setup

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dktn7/proj-automation.git
cd proj-automation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**System Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- wkhtmltopdf (for PDF generation)
- tesseract-ocr (for OCR functionality)

```sh
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf tesseract-ocr

# macOS
brew install wkhtmltopdf tesseract

# Windows
# Download from: https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
# Download tesseract from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

### Optional: FFmpeg for audio processing (Windows)

If you use audio features locally or on Windows CI, ffmpeg must be available on PATH. A helper script is provided to install ffmpeg for developers or CI runners on Windows.

From the repository root run:

```powershell
./scripts/install_ffmpeg.ps1
```

This script will attempt a user-level install via Scoop, fall back to Chocolatey, and finally download a portable static build and add it to the user PATH.

CI integration: the GitHub Actions workflow includes a Windows runner step that runs this script before tests to ensure ffmpeg is present on Windows runners.

Note: if Chocolatey is used, it may require administrator privileges on the runner or machine. The installer script falls back to a portable download when admin rights are not available.
```

### 2. Configure Discord Bot

1. Create Discord Application:
   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Create a New Application, then add a Bot and copy the bot token

2. Set Bot Permissions:
   - In "OAuth2" ‚Üí "URL Generator", select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Recommended bot permissions:
     - Send Messages
     - Use Slash Commands
     - Create Public Threads
     - Send Messages in Threads
     - Embed Links
     - Attach Files

3. Configure Environment:
   ```sh
   cp bot/.env.template bot/.env
   ```

   Example `.env` values:
   ```
   BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key            # optional for AI features
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token                # required for GitHub integration
   ADMIN_USER_IDS=123456789012345678,987654321098765432  # comma-separated Discord user IDs
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   STRUCTURED_LOGS=false
   ```

4. Run the Bot:
   ```sh
   cd bot
   python main.py
   ```

   The bot will:
   - Initialize SQLite database for conversation memory
   - Validate configuration and show available features
   - Sync slash commands with Discord
   - Begin monitoring for DMs and code blocks

### 3. Configure GitHub Actions

1. Set Repository Secrets:
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"

     - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` ‚Äî webhook for PDF notifications

2. Create Discord Webhook:
   - Discord channel settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí New Webhook
   - Copy the Webhook URL

### 4. Test the Platform

1. Test PDF Conversion:
   ```sh
   python scripts/md_to_pdf.py docs/ideasheets/sample_idea.md -o output/
   ```

2. Test Discord Integration (with valid webhook):
   ```sh
   python scripts/send_pdf_to_discord.py output/sample_idea.pdf \
     --webhook "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
     --message "Test PDF from automation platform"
   ```

3. Test Complete Workflow:

## CI requirements for PDF / audio features

Some features (Markdown‚ÜíPDF generation and audio processing) require native
libraries that are not always present on GitHub-hosted runners, especially on
Windows. The repository contains helper scripts and CI diagnostics to make
these requirements explicit.

What the CI does today
- The `test` job runs a diagnostic script `scripts/check_native_deps.py` that
   prints whether `ffmpeg` and the WeasyPrint Python package/native libs are
   available. This step is non-failing and is intended to provide clear logs
   for maintainers.
- On Windows runners the workflow also attempts to run `scripts/install_ffmpeg.ps1`.
   This script tries Scoop, Chocolatey, and finally downloads a portable ffmpeg
   build to the user profile. Installing WeasyPrint native libs on Windows is
   best-effort and may require admin rights.

Recommended options
- If you need reliable PDF rendering in CI, prefer an Ubuntu runner where the
   native packages can be installed via apt (`libcairo2`, `libpango-1.0-0`,
   `libpangocairo-1.0-0`, `libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0`, `libffi-dev`, `shared-mime-info`).
- For Windows-specific pipelines, consider using a self-hosted runner that has
   the required native libraries preinstalled, or enable Chocolatey and install
   the native runtimes there.
- If PDF/audio features are not required for every PR, keep the diagnostic
   script non-failing (the default) and run full PDF/audio integration tests on
   an explicit job or a scheduled workflow that uses an appropriate runner.

How to opt-in to failing CI on missing deps
- You can change the diagnostic step to fail CI if dependencies are missing by
   running `python scripts/check_native_deps.py --fail-on-missing` in the job.
   This was intentionally left as an opt-in change because GitHub-hosted
   Windows runners may not permit installing the required native libraries.

If you want, I can add a short Troubleshooting snippet with exact apt / choco
commands in this README or create a dedicated `docs/CI.md` with step-by-step
instructions for setting up self-hosted runners.
