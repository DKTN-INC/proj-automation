# Discord Standup Workflow Addition Summary

This document summarizes the addition of the Discord multi-channel standup workflow to all specified branches.

## Workflow File Added

**File**: `.github/workflows/standup-multi-channel.yml`

**Content**: A GitHub Actions workflow named "Standup Digest (manual, multi-channel)" that:
- Triggers manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- Accepts two inputs:
  - `channels`: Discord channels for standup (default: 'general,development')
  - `team`: Team name for standup (default: 'development')
- Runs on ubuntu-latest
- Outputs standup information including team, channels, date, and triggering user

## Branches Modified

The workflow has been successfully added to the following branches:

1. ✅ **main** - Commit: 0a87956
2. ✅ **chore/scaffold-automation** - Commit: 1e4814e  
3. ✅ **chore/scaffold-automation-teammate-pack** - Commit: 3cbc203
4. ✅ **chore/standup-manual-only** - Commit: 9ddb261
5. ✅ **copilot/fix-3352140c-c05b-48f3-bb72-8150b92cc113** - Commit: b3b75fd

## Implementation Notes

- Each branch received the identical workflow file
- For branches that didn't have the `.github/workflows/` directory, it was created
- All commits used the same commit message: "Add Discord multi-channel standup workflow"
- The workflow is based on the existing `daily-standup.yml` pattern but enhanced for Discord multi-channel support

## Workflow Features

The new workflow provides:
- Manual trigger capability
- Configurable Discord channel targeting
- Team-specific standup generation  
- Comprehensive logging of standup metadata
- Integration with GitHub Actions ecosystem using standard checkout action

## Optional WeasyPrint fail-fast check (added to CI)

The repository CI now includes an optional fail-fast job that validates the native runtime required by WeasyPrint (GTK/Cairo/Pango) on `ubuntu-latest`.

- Toggle via workflow dispatch input `fail_on_missing_weasy: true` when running the workflow manually.
- Or set the repository/workflow environment variable `FAIL_ON_MISSING_WEASY=true` to enable the check on pushes and PRs.

This job installs system packages and runs `scripts/check_native_deps.py --fail-on-missing`. It is intended to reduce noise by remaining off by default while allowing strict validation when desired.

## Optional Secret Presence Check

An optional `secret-presence-check` job can be enabled by setting the workflow environment variable `ENFORCE_SECRET_PRESENCE=true`. When enabled, the job will fail early if required secrets (for example `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`) are not configured in the repository secrets. This is intended to avoid runtime failures where workflows assume secrets exist.

Note: enforcement is skipped for forked pull requests to allow external contributors to open PRs without having repository secrets configured. The check will still run for PRs originating from branches in the main repository and for push events if enabled.
