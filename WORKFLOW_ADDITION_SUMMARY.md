# Discord Standup Workflow Addition Summary

This document summarizes the addition of the Discord multi-channel standup workflow to all specified branches.

## Workflow File Added

**File**: `.github/workflows/standup-multi-channel.yml`

**Content**: A GitHub Actions workflow named "Standup Digest (manual, multi-channel)" that:
- Triggers manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- Accepts two inputs:
  - `channels`: Discord channels for standup (default: 'general,development')
  - `team`: Team name for standup (default: 'development')
- Runs on ubuntu-latest
- Outputs standup information including team, channels, date, and triggering user

## Branches Modified

The workflow has been successfully added to the following branches:

1. ✅ **main** - Commit: 0a87956
2. ✅ **chore/scaffold-automation** - Commit: 1e4814e  
3. ✅ **chore/scaffold-automation-teammate-pack** - Commit: 3cbc203

5. ✅ **copilot/fix-3352140c-c05b-48f3-bb72-8150b92cc113** - Commit: b3b75fd

## Implementation Notes

- Each branch received the identical workflow file
- For branches that didn't have the `.github/workflows/` directory, it was created
- All commits used the same commit message: "Add Discord multi-channel standup workflow"
- The workflow is based on the existing `daily-standup.yml` pattern but enhanced for Discord multi-channel support

## Workflow Features

The new workflow provides:
- Manual trigger capability
- Configurable Discord channel targeting
- Team-specific standup generation  
- Comprehensive logging of standup metadata
- Integration with GitHub Actions ecosystem using standard checkout action
