# Reliability and Resiliency Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive reliability and resiliency improvements implemented in the Project Automation platform.

## Overview

The reliability enhancements provide robust error handling, self-healing capabilities, and monitoring across all components of the automation platform. These improvements ensure the system can handle failures gracefully and maintain operational stability.

## Core Reliability Components

### 1. Health Monitoring System (`bot/health_monitor.py`)

The health monitoring system provides continuous monitoring of system resources and component health.

**Features:**
- Real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk usage, and file handles
- Custom health check registration for application-specific metrics
- Automated alerting with configurable cooldowns
- Health status aggregation and reporting

**Usage:**
```python
from health_monitor import health_monitor, start_health_monitoring

# Start monitoring with 60-second intervals
await start_health_monitoring(interval=60)

# Get current health status
health_status = await health_monitor.check_all_health()
print(f"Overall status: {health_status.overall_status}")

# Register custom health check
def check_database_connection():
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "value": 1,
        "message": "Database connection active"
    }

health_monitor.register_custom_check("database", check_database_connection)
```

**Health Metrics:**
- **Memory Usage**: Monitors RAM consumption with configurable thresholds
- **Disk Usage**: Tracks disk space utilization
- **CPU Usage**: Monitors processor utilization
- **File Handles**: Tracks open file descriptors to prevent leaks
- **Process Health**: Monitors process-specific metrics like RSS memory and thread count

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern (`bot/circuit_breaker.py`)

Circuit breakers protect against cascading failures by failing fast when external services are unavailable.

**Features:**
- Configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts
- Automatic state transitions (closed → open → half-open → closed)
- Exponential backoff and retry logic
- Per-service circuit breaker isolation

**Usage:**
```python
from circuit_breaker import circuit_breaker, create_http_circuit_config

# Use as decorator
@circuit_breaker("external_api", create_http_circuit_config())
async def call_external_api():
    # API call logic here
    pass

# Or use directly
from circuit_breaker import circuit_manager

breaker = circuit_manager.get_breaker("my_service")
result = await breaker.call(my_function)
```

**Circuit States:**
- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **Open**: Circuit breaker triggered, requests fail fast
- **Half-Open**: Testing recovery, limited requests allowed

### 3. Resource Management (`bot/resource_manager.py`)

Comprehensive resource management prevents leaks and manages system resources efficiently.

**Features:**
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files and HTTP sessions
- Memory management with garbage collection monitoring
- Resource pooling and lifecycle management
- Configurable resource limits and timeouts

**Usage:**
```python
from resource_manager import temporary_file, get_http_session, cleanup_resources

# Temporary file with auto-cleanup
async with temporary_file(suffix=".pdf") as temp_file:
    # File operations here
    temp_file.write_text("content")
    # File automatically cleaned up on exit

# Managed HTTP session
session = await get_http_session("api_client")
async with session.get("https://api.example.com") as response:
    data = await response.json()

# Global resource cleanup
await cleanup_resources()
```

**Resource Types:**
- **Temporary Files**: Auto-cleanup with configurable age limits
- **HTTP Sessions**: Connection pooling with timeout management
- **Memory**: Garbage collection monitoring and forced cleanup

### 4. Enhanced Retry Mechanisms (`bot/retry_utils.py`)

Sophisticated retry strategies for handling transient failures.

**Features:**
- Multiple retry strategies (exponential, linear, fixed delay)
- Configurable retry policies with jitter
- Comprehensive retry statistics and monitoring
- Strategy-specific exception handling

**Usage:**
```python
from retry_utils import retry_async, ExponentialBackoffStrategy

# Use as decorator
@retry_async(max_retries=3, base_delay=1.0)
async def flaky_operation():
    # Operation that might fail
    pass

# Custom strategy
strategy = ExponentialBackoffStrategy(
    base_delay=1.0,
    max_delay=30.0,
    max_retries=5,
    retryable_exceptions=(ConnectionError, TimeoutError)
)

@retry_async(strategy=strategy)
async def reliable_operation():
    # Operation with custom retry strategy
    pass
```

**Retry Strategies:**
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays with optional jitter
- **Linear Backoff**: Fixed increment delays
- **Fixed Delay**: Constant delays between retries

### 5. Reliability Configuration (`bot/reliability_config.py`)

Centralized configuration management for all reliability settings.

**Features:**
- Environment variable based configuration
- Validation and logging of reliability settings
- Type-safe configuration classes
- Default values with override capabilities

**Configuration Sections:**
```python
from reliability_config import get_reliability_config

config = get_reliability_config()

# Circuit breaker settings
cb_config = config.circuit_breaker
print(f"Failure threshold: {cb_config.failure_threshold}")

# Health monitor settings
hm_config = config.health_monitor
print(f"Check interval: {hm_config.check_interval}s")

# Rate limiting settings
rl_config = config.rate_limit
print(f"OpenAI RPM: {rl_config.openai_requests_per_minute}")
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `CB_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`: Circuit breaker failure threshold (default: 5)
- `CB_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT`: Circuit breaker recovery timeout in seconds (default: 60)
- `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`: Health check interval in seconds (default: 60)
- `HEALTH_MEMORY_THRESHOLD_MB`: Memory threshold in MB (default: 500)
- `RATE_LIMIT_OPENAI_RPM`: OpenAI requests per minute (default: 60)

## Enhanced Components

wrapper = OpenAIWrapper(
    api_key="your-key",
    enable_circuit_breaker=True,
    rate_limit_requests_per_minute=60
)

# Get health status

import asyncio
import sys; sys.path.append('bot')
from health_monitor import get_system_health
health = asyncio.run(get_system_health())
print(f'Memory: {health.metrics[\"memory_usage\"].message}')
"
```

#### Circuit Breaker Opened
```bash
# Check circuit breaker status
python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.append('bot')
from circuit_breaker import circuit_manager
stats = circuit_manager.get_health_status()
print(f'Open breakers: {stats[\"open_breakers\"]}')
"
```

#### Resource Leaks
```bash
# Force resource cleanup
python3 -c "
import asyncio
import sys; sys.path.append('bot')
from resource_manager import cleanup_resources
asyncio.run(cleanup_resources())
print('Resources cleaned up')
"
```

### Log Analysis

Monitor log outputs for reliability insights:

2. **Metrics Collection**: Integrate with monitoring systems (Prometheus, etc.)
3. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical data
4. **Chaos Engineering**: Automated failure injection for testing
5. **Dashboard Integration**: Web-based reliability dashboard

## Conclusion

The reliability and resiliency improvements provide a robust foundation for the Project Automation platform. These features ensure the system can handle failures gracefully, recover automatically, and maintain operational stability under various conditions.

Regular monitoring, testing, and maintenance of these reliability features will ensure continued platform stability and reliability.
