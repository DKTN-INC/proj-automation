# Discord Integration Test

This is a test idea sheet to verify the new Discord webhook integration works properly.

## Features Tested

### Currency Formatting
- UK Defaults: GBP, en_GB, £ symbol
- Example amounts:
  - Small: £9.99
  - Medium: £1,234.56  
  - Large: £1,000,000.00

### Async Discord Webhook
- PDF upload via aiohttp
- Rich embeds with metadata
- Environment variable configuration
- Graceful fallback when webhook not configured

### Integrated Workflow
- Markdown processing with `--discord` flag
- Automatic PDF generation
- Discord notification with document summary

## Expected Behavior

When this document is processed with Discord integration enabled:

1. ✅ Markdown is converted to HTML
2. ✅ HTML is converted to PDF 
3. ✅ PDF is sent to Discord (if webhook configured)
4. ✅ Rich embed includes title, summary, and metadata
5. ✅ Word count and generation timestamp included

## Test Results

This document should demonstrate the complete workflow from markdown to Discord notification.
